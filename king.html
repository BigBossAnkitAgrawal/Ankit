                    <h2>What is Share Market?</h2>
                    <p>The market is just the communication happening about money between humans. Just like any other communication such as verbal language, body language, and eye expression language, there are a lot of other non-verbal languages. The share market is one of those languages; the only small difference is that the money speaks for itself.</p>
                    <p>People are continuously talking verbally about money in the market. An amateur trader comes to the market and usually becomes one of the crowds. Before understanding the basics of this language, he becomes part of the crowd and starts buying and selling based on any technical or fundamental approach.</p>

                <h2>Role of Market psychology in Share market</h2>
                <p><h8>Imagine a merchant from the village with 50,000 bucks in his pocket and his candies going to a shopping mall. After reaching a mall, he lost his mind in the glamour and all the precious sparkling things. Instead of selling his product, he starts buying others with the money he took with him. This is where he loses his mantra of trading.<br>

                    The same happens with the beginner trader. He comes into the share market to do the right trade which will make him profitable, but the sparkling market plays with his emotions and he buys somewhere else without his wish but with the wish of his greed and fear.<br>
                    
                    Here the psychology of the share market is necessary. A trader predicts that ABC stock is going up within 2 days, but still he can’t be sure about the stock. Not being sure inculcates emotions and this misleads a trader.<br>
                    
                    A professional trader is one who understands the problem that one can never be confident about his trade but still he has to be disciplined about his trade.<br>
                    
                    A disciplined trader works on his emotions that no matter where the market will influence him, he should be focused on how you are going to manage the trade. He knows that whatever indicator or theory he uses; it won’t be profitable till he won’t understand his own emotions.<br>
                    
                    Most of the crowd who is communicating is actually communicating unconsciously. This is exactly how we use to live our lives. We become angry only if triggered by someone else. Being happy, egoistic, fearful, lovable, dramatic, or even sad, these are happens based on our emotional cycle. Understanding our emotions and being aware of the emotions makes an edge in the share market.<br></p>
